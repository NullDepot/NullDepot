I'm a dynamic student in an interdisciplinary education in Philosophy, Politics, Law, and Economics (PPLE) combined with a Bachelor of Laws (LLB) at IE University in the heart of Madrid.

## Objective

My PPLE and legal journey has led me to develop a passion for data protection and cybersecurity, and I am now eager to transition into this field, specifically aiming to join a Security Operations Centre (SOC) as a Tier 1 Analyst.
